class DataCreateCommand(BaseCommand):
    """
    This class is an abstract base class for creating data in the database using Django management
    commands. It provides a structure for defining the logic to gather data, create instances of
    models with that data, and handle the creation process.

    Instance attributes:
        employee (NoneType): Placeholder for the queryset of Employee objects, to be overridden
            in subclasses.
        client (NoneType): Placeholder for the queryset of Client objects, to be overridden
            in subclasses.
        contract (NoneType): Placeholder for the queryset of Contract objects, to be overridden
            in subclasses.
        event (NoneType): Placeholder for the queryset of Event objects, to be overridden
            in subclasses.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, *args, **options): Initializes the command with optional arguments and
            options.

            Args:
                *args: Variable length argument list.
                **options: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

        get_queryset(self): Placeholder method to be overridden in subclasses. It should
            initialize the queryset for the model to be created.

        create_fake_data(self): Placeholder method to be overridden in subclasses. It should
            generate fake data for creating instances of the model.

        create_instances(self, data): Placeholder method to be overridden in subclasses. It should
            create instances of the model in the database using the provided data.

        handle(self, *args, **options): Executes the command to create data in the database.
            Args:
                *args: Variable length argument list.
                **options: Arbitrary keyword arguments.
