class Command(EpicEventsCommand):
    """
    This class `Command` is a subclass of `EpicEventsCommand` designed to facilitate the creation
    of new contract within a system. It is specifically tailored for users with "MA" permissions,
    indicating that it is intended for management.

    - `help`: A string describing the command's purpose, which is to prompt for details necessary
        to create a new contract.
    - `action`: A string indicating the action associated with this command, set to "CREATE".
    - `permissions`: A list of roles that are allowed to execute this command, in this case, only
        "MA" (Management) has the permission.

    Key methods within this class include:

    - `get_queryset`: Initializes the queryset for `Contract` objects, selecting related `Client`
        objects for each client.
    - `get_create_model_table`: Generates tables of all contracts and a subset of clients related
        to the employee with role ('SA') which is responsible for the client, displaying relevant
        information such as email of the client, total costs, amount already paid, state of the
        contract and the employee.
    - `get_data`: Prompts the user to input details for creating a new contract, capturing client
        email, the total costs, the paid amount and the state of the contract.
    - `make_changes`: Validates if the client exists otherwise it prints an error message.
        Attempts to create a new `Contract` object with the provided data, associating it with the
        responsible client `Employee` object. And verifies if the contract already exists.
    - `collect_changes`: Confirms the creation of a new contract and displays a success message.
    - `go_back`: Provides an option to go back to the previous command, presumably to the main
        contract management interface.

    This class encapsulates the functionality for creating new contracts, ensuring that only users
    with the appropriate permissions can perform this action. It leverages the `EpicEventsCommand`
    class for common command functionalities, such as displaying input prompts
    and handling user input.
