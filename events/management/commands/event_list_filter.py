class Command(EpicEventsCommand):
    """
    This class `Command` is a subclass of `EpicEventsCommand` designed to list all events with an
    option to filter the list based on user input. It is accessible to users with "SA", "SU", or
    "MA" permissions.

    - `help`: A string describing the command's purpose, which is to list all events
        and optionally filter them.
    - `action`: A string indicating the action associated with this command, set to "LIST_FILTER".
    - `permissions`: A list of roles that are allowed to execute this command, in this case, "SA"
        (Sales), "SU" (Support), and "MA" (Management) have the permission.

    Key methods within this class include:

    - `get_queryset`: Initializes the queryset for `Event` objects, selecting related `Contract`
        and `Employee` objects for each event.
    - `get_create_model_table`: Generates a table of all events, displaying relevant information
        such as client email, date, name, location, maximum guest number, and employee.
    - `get_data`: Prompts the user to decide whether they want to filter events,
        capturing their choice.
    - `user_choice`: Handles the user's choice to filter events, with special handling for "SA"
        and "SU" role to allow filtering without permission denied messages.
    - `choose_attributes`: Displays fields available for filtering and allows the user to select
        which fields they want to filter by.
    - `request_field_selection`: Prompts the user to select specific fields for filtering and to
        choose the order (ascending or descending).
    - `get_user_queryset`: Filters the queryset based on the user's selection and order preference.
    - `filter_selected_fields`: Applies the selected filters and order to the queryset, preparing
        it for display.
    - `display_result`: Displays the filtered and ordered list of events to the user.
    - `go_back`: Provides an option to go back to the previous command, presumably to the main
        event management interface.

    This class encapsulates the functionality for listing and optionally filtering events,
    ensuring that only users with the appropriate permissions can perform these actions.
    It leverages the `EpicEventsCommand` class for common command functionalities, such as
    displaying input prompts and handling user input.
