class Command(EpicEventsCommand):
    """
    This script defines a class `Command` that inherits from `EpicEventsCommand`. It provides a
    menu for operations around employees based on the user's role.

    - The `help` attribute provides a brief description of the command's purpose.
    - The `permissions` attribute lists the roles that have permission to execute this command.
    - The `handle` method is overridden to customize the command's behavior based on the user's
        role and their choice from the application menu.

    The `handle` method performs the following operations:
    - Calls the superclass's `handle` method to ensure proper initialization.
    - Retrieves the user's choice from the application menu for the "client" section.
    - Depending on the user's role (`SA`, `SU`, or `MA`), it executes different commands based
        on the user's choice:
        - For `MA` role:
            - Choice  1: Calls `employee_list` command.
            - Choice  2: Calls `employee_create` command.
            - Choice  3: Calls `employee_update` command.
            - Choice  4: Calls `employee_delete` command.
            - Choice  5: Calls `start` command.
        - For `SU` and `SA` roles:
            - Choice  1: Calls `employee_list` command.
            - Choice  2: Calls `start` command.

    This class demonstrates the use of inheritance and role-based access control in a command-line
    interface, allowing for a flexible and secure management of client operations.
