class Command(EpicEventsCommand):
    """
    This class `Command` is a subclass of `EpicEventsCommand` designed to facilitate the creation
    of new clients within a system. It is specifically tailored for users with "SA" permissions,
    indicating that it is intended for sales.

    - `help`: A string describing the command's purpose, which is to prompt for details necessary
        to create a new client.
    - `action`: A string indicating the action associated with this command, set to "CREATE".
    - `permissions`: A list of roles that are allowed to execute this command, in this case, only
        "SA" (Sales) has the permission.

    Key methods within this class include:

    - `get_queryset`: Initializes the queryset for `Client` objects, selecting related `Employee`
        objects for each client.
    - `get_create_model_table`: Generates tables of all clients and a subset of clients related to
        the current user, displaying relevant information such as email, first name, last name,
        company name, and employee.
    - `get_data`: Prompts the user to input details for creating a new client, capturing email,
        first name, last name, phone number, and company name.
    - `make_changes`: Attempts to create a new `Client` object with the provided data, associating
        it with the current user's `Employee` object. Handles potential `IntegrityError` by
        displaying an error message and re-prompting the user to create a client.
    - `collect_changes`: Confirms the creation of a new client and displays a success message.
    - `go_back`: Provides an option to go back to the previous command, presumably to the main
        client management interface.

    This class encapsulates the functionality for creating new clients, ensuring that only users
    with the appropriate permissions can perform this action. It leverages the `EpicEventsCommand`
    class for common command functionalities, such as displaying input prompts
    and handling user input.
