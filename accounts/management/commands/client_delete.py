class Command(EpicEventsCommand):
    """
    This class `Command` is a subclass of `EpicEventsCommand` designed for managing client
    deletions within a system. It is specifically tailored for users with "MA" permissions,
    indicating that it is intended for managers.

    - `help`: A string describing the command's purpose, which is to prompt for details necessary
        to delete a client.
    - `action`: A string indicating the action associated with this command, set to "DELETE".
    - `permissions`: A list of roles that are allowed to execute this command, in this case, only
        "MA" (Management) has the permission.

    Key methods within this class include:

    - `get_create_model_table`: Generates a table of all client emails to help the user select a
        client to delete.
    - `get_requested_model`: Prompts the user to input the email address of the client they wish
        to delete and displays the client's details for confirmation.
    - `get_data`: Prompts the user to confirm the deletion of the selected client.
    - `make_changes`: If the user confirms the deletion, it proceeds to delete the client;
        otherwise, it cancels the operation and returns to the client management interface.
    - `collect_changes`: Confirms the deletion of the client and displays a success message.
    - `go_back`: Provides an option to go back to the previous command, presumably to the main
        client management interface.

    This class encapsulates the functionality for deleting clients, ensuring that only users with
    the appropriate permissions can perform this action. It leverages
    the `EpicEventsCommand` class for common command functionalities, such as displaying input
    prompts and handling user input.
