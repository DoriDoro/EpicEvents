class UserManager(BaseUserManager):

    The `UserManager` class is a custom manager for the `User` model, extending Django's
    `BaseUserManager`. It provides methods for creating users and superusers, ensuring that email
    addresses are normalized and that superusers have the appropriate permissions set.

    - `create_user`: Creates a new user with the given email and password. It normalizes the email
        address and sets the password. This method is designed to handle the creation
        of regular users.
    - `create_superuser`: Creates a new superuser with the given email and password. It ensures
        that superusers have `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, and `is_active` set to `True`.
        This method is specifically for creating superusers with full permissions.

    These methods are essential for managing user accounts within a Django application, providing
    a secure and flexible way to handle user authentication and authorization. By using custom
    methods for creating users and superusers, the `UserManager` allows for the implementation of
    custom logic and validation that aligns with the specific requirements of the application.

class User(AbstractUser):

    This class `User` is a custom user model for Django applications, designed to use email
    addresses as the primary identifier for user authentication instead of traditional usernames.
    It extends `AbstractUser` to inherit all the fields and methods necessary for user management,
    including authentication and authorization.

    - `username`: This field is set to `None` to indicate that email addresses will be used for
        authentication instead of usernames.
    - `email` (EmailField): An `EmailField` that is marked as unique, ensuring that each email address can only
        be associated with one user account.

    - `USERNAME_FIELD`: Specifies the field to be used as the unique identifier for authentication,
        which is set to `'email'`.
    - `REQUIRED_FIELDS`: Specifies additional fields that must be filled out when creating a user.
        Since the email field is required and unique, this list is empty.

    - `objects`: Assigns the custom `UserManager` to handle the creation of user and superuser
        instances.

    The `UserManager` class, `UserManager`, is a custom manager for the `User` model. It provides
    methods for creating users and superusers, ensuring that email addresses are normalized and
    that superusers have the appropriate permissions set.

    - `create_user`: Creates a new user with the given email and password. It normalizes the email

    - `create_superuser`: Creates a new superuser with the given email and password. It ensures
        that superusers have `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, and `is_active` set to `True`.

    This custom user model allows for a more straightforward authentication flow, where users log
    in using their email addresses, and it provides a flexible foundation for customizing user
    management features in Django applications.
